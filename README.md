## What is a Data Scientist?

* A Data Scientist works with data to try and deliver value to a business.

__But how is that achieved?__

* Data Science can sometimes overlap with domains such as Data Analysts, Data Engineers and DevOps.
* How much the Data Scientists role overlaps with these other roles really depends on the company, but in essence a Data Scientist is generally focused on modeling data to be able to accurately predict an outcome, for example, predicting how likely customers are to leave.
* 4 core skills are used as a Data Scientist: statistics, mathematics, programming and communication.

## Key roles and responsibilities of a Data Scientist at BCG GAMMA
BCG GAMMA is transforming businesses using data science to help companies generate competitive advantage. To do this, we typically follow a 5-step methodology:

1. __Business understanding & problem framing:__ what is the context of this problem and why are they trying to solve it?
2. __Exploratory data analysis & data cleaning:__ what data are we working with, what does it look like and how can we make it better?
3. __Feature engineering:__ can we enrich this dataset using our own expertise or third party information?
4. __Modeling and evaluation:__ can we use this dataset to accurately make predictions? If so, are they reliable?
5. __Insights & Recommendations:__ how we can communicate the value of these predictions by explaining them in a way that matters to the business?

## “Why are you interested in this role?”

I recently participated in BCG's Data Science job simulation on the Forage platform, and it was incredibly useful to understand what it might be like to participate on a data science and analytics team at BCG.

I worked on a project to create a customer churn analysis simulation using Python. This project built my data science skills in a real-world context, as well as my presentation skills through creating an executive summary of my findings for the team. 

Doing this program confirmed that I really enjoy working on data science projects and I'm excited to apply these skills on a data science team at a company like BCG.
