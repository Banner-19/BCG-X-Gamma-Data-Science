Your AD is giving you more responsibility!
Well done for your initial understanding of the case with PowerCo. After reviewing your project plan, the AD would like you lead on the Data Science deliverables for the rest of the project.

The AD would like you to investigate whether price sensitivity is the most influential factor for a customer churning, and if not, to what extent does price sensitivity influence churn.

Before we begin on this task, what exactly is price sensitivity?

# What is price sensitivity?
* Price sensitivity is the degree to which demand changes when the cost of a product or service changes.

* In the context of PowerCo, the “demand” refers to the demand for energy consumption.

* Price sensitivity is commonly measured using the price elasticity of demand, which states that some consumers won't pay more if a lower-priced option is available.


* __What is price elasticity of demand?__

  * Price elasticity of demand is a measurement of the change in consumption of a product in relation to a change in its price

# Exploratory data analysis
* The client has sent over 2 datasets and it your responsibility to perform some exploratory data analysis.

* __What is exploratory data analysis?__

  * Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is a technique used by a Data Scientist to gain a holistic understanding of the data that they are working with.

  * It is mainly based around using statistical techniques (such as descriptive statistics) and visualizations to gain a deeper understanding of the statistical properties that the data holds.
